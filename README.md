## Notakto

The Notakto file contains the code of the simple Notakto game. The notakto game is a version of Tic Tac Toe but with three boards and it always ends with a winner. 

* A Brief Description
Notakto is a tic-tac-toe variant. It is played across three 3 x 3 boards: Board A, board B and board C. When you start the game you should output the boards as follows.
There are two players: Player 1 and player 2. Player 1 always starts. Both players play the same piece: X. E.g., let player 1 choose location 6 on board A, i.e., the user will enter A6.Each player takes turn placing an X on the board in a vacant space (a space not already occupied by an X).If a board has three X in a row, column, or diagonal, the board is dead and it cannot be played anymore. It should not be displayed anymore. E.g., in the following, board A becomes dead and is not displayed anymore.The game ends when all the boards contain three X in a row, column, or diagonal, at which point the player to have made the last move loses the game. Unlike tic-tac-toe, there will always be a player who wins any game of Notakto.

## Notakto AI

It is an AI version of Notatkto which only one person can play at one time. The only thing to note here is that The AI will be the Player 1, i.e., the AI will always start.
